## Kai Zheng
*Computer Vision*
Currently, I'm a CV algorithm engineer at the Megvii Technology (Face++). I got my MTech degree from Insitute of System Science of the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) in July 2021.

My research interests mainly lies in computer vision, especially the 3D, object detection and self-supervised learning.
